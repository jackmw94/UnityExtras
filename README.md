# UnityExtras
A collection of extensions, utilities and tools that come in handy when developing in Unity. I found myself writing similar code for each new project I'd start or trying to remember subtle differences in my implementations across projects SO thus came about this repository. Just a load of useful stuff, feel free to send feedback, make changes and submit pull requests, etc.
