# UnityExtras
A collection of extensions, utilities and tools that come in handy when developing in Unity. I found myself writing similar code for each new project I'd start or trying to remember subtle differences in my implementations across projects SO thus came about this repository.

This is thoroughly a work in progress, feel free to send feedback, make changes and submit pull requests, etc.
